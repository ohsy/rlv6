problem: gymnasium[box2d] is not installed
solution: python version is 3.11 now. Should be downgraded. 
        Install miniconda to use python 3.9 and install tensorflow and etc. cf. https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#macos
        Now gymnasium[box2d] is installed well.

problem: critic loss and actor loss increase after some episodes.
solution: found that hard update and soft update are mixed. A soft update is done every 500 steps. The hard update part is removed.
