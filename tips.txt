problem: gymnasium[box2d] is not installed
solution: python version is 3.11 now. Should be downgraded. 
        Install miniconda to use python 3.9 and install tensorflow and etc. cf. https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#macos
        Now gymnasium[box2d] is installed well.


problem: critic loss and actor loss increase after some episodes.
solution: 
    - found that actionToEnv is input to critic instead of action itself (from actor). 
        Note that the scaling from action to actionToEnv is not made with Tensorflow. 
        The backpropagation from Q of critic to actor should be through action instead of actionToEnv.


tip: it seems that "linear" shows better performance than "tanh" for actor's mean layer's activation in SAC.


problem: tape gradient for softmax in SAC_entropy is NaN after some episodes.
solution: found that the exp(x) for large x results in gradient explosion.
    - Use clip_by_value(x, -13, 1) for x just before exp().  # -13 and 1 is from a code. Another code uses -20 and 2.
    - activation = "softmax" cannot be used. 
        Use activation = "linear" and then clip_by_value() and then Softmax() layer. 


tip: how to print keras tensor xxx
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K
xxx = K.print_tensor(xxx, message="xxx=")


problem: After tensorflow installation with miniconda, GPU execution is not working. 
        https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#linux
solution: At the bottom part of the above page, there is Ubuntu 22.04 part.
        Though mine is Ubuntu 18.04, the same solution is working too.


problem: background processes are killed some time after log out.
        It is logged in /var/log/syslog  like 
        Stopping user manager for UID ...
solution: cf. https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/682793/why-background-process-terminated-after-ssh-session-closed
        in /etc/systemd/logind.conf
        KillExcludeUsers=yourusername
        or
        KillUserProcesses=no


problem: how to connect to the localhost in the local browser to see tensorboard on the remote server 
solution: 
	- connect with -L option like, in .bash_profile:
	alias   to30='ssh -Y -L 16006:127.0.0.1:6006 soh@172.30.1.30'
	cf. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37987839/how-can-i-run-tensorboard-on-a-remote-server
	"What it does is that everything on the port 6006 of the server (in 127.0.0.1:6006) will be forwarded to my machine on the port 16006."
	- tensorboard on the remote server as usual like: 
	$ tensorboard --logdir=./log/CartPole-v1_DQN_train/1004_0709_summary
	- connect to http://localhost:16006/ on the local browser
