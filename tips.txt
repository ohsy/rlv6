problem: gymnasium[box2d] is not installed
solution: python version is 3.11 now. Should be downgraded. 
        Install miniconda to use python 3.9 and install tensorflow and etc. cf. https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#macos
        Now gymnasium[box2d] is installed well.

problem: critic loss and actor loss increase after some episodes.
solution: 
    - found that actionToEnv is input to critic instead of action itself (from actor). 
        Note that the scaling from action to actionToEnv is not made with Tensorflow. 
        The backpropagation from Q of critic to actor should be through action instead of actionToEnv.

tip: it seems that "linear" shows better performance than "tanh" for actor's mean layer's activation in SAC.
